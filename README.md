This was our group project of cse 3200 : System Develeopment Project. 
We found some problems that our farmers face in this digiital era which we tried to solve using this app. 
Many e-commerce platform sell products but gives a little to no option to the buyer to talk to the seller before he buys a product.
As many of the farmers don't have the capital to buy new equipment we have created a platform that let the farmers rent others' underutilized equipments.
We wanted to bring the farmers together in a room for better access to their needs. So, we created a community forum where they can express their thought and ask for help or inquire.
For further communication we have added a real time messaging system.
For bette crop planning it is a must to have the sense of the weather and the forecast.
Many research are done on agriculture which is a rich source for the farmers to learn new ways and earn new knowledge rather than to rely upon their instinct and old knowledge of farming.
